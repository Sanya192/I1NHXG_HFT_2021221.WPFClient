TODO

FIRST:
All project must be in .NET 5.
Let's pray.
Finished until 3.1

BeforeMilestone:
Refactor the whole. The code was built in 2019 and I was insecure about req. It needs a refactor to be buggy less :D

Milestone1:
WPF app for the CRUD. There could be more functions than the CRUD, but First you must do the must have req nicely.

Milestone2:
MVC app. A nice ASP.net app should be nice.

Milestone3:
API with a WPF app.
